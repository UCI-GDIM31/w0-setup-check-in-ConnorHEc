# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
Video games are the best way for me to relax. My usual favourite games are World of Warcraft and Hearthstone Legends. I hope I can become an independent game developer in the future. I've participated in other game course programmes at UCI before, and I've learned some of the basics of game development.
2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ✓] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I want to learn how to write game-related code, such as behavioural patterns of NPCs and determination of various level mechanics

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
In fact, I'm really looking forward to this course.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
python
2. Game development (any engine)
unity 2022
3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
Initial game design proposal with a plan and stage-by-stage outlook for the upcoming design
2. Scope management
Plan and control costs and outputs
3. Iteration
The game development process is constantly testing and updating versions of the game. in order to optimise parts that were not considered in the initial design
4. Object-Oriented programming
Programming around specific objects
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
